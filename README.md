## ENEMY AI:

### BEARS:

**IDLE**:
- When idle, bears will be standing around a cache of honey, chatting or looking around suspiciously.
- We could have a few different types of bears, each with a different idle animation.
- They'll usually be ina group but it's possible that we could encounter one on its own without a cache of honey. But that bear will want Honey Bear's (HB's) stash.

**AGGRO/AGGRESSIVE**:
- When coming into a certain range of the baddie Bears, they'll start walking towards HB, throwing honey. If they get close enough, they might bash HB with a stick.
